# Project Memory & System Architecture

## 🏗️ Core Architecture & System Flow

### System Design
**Dual-Agent Microservice + Next.js Dashboard** — The system consists of two independent Python voice agents (inbound & outbound) that communicate via LiveKit's real-time infrastructure, orchestrated by a Next.js 16 dashboard. Configuration is bridged through a shared JSON file (`data/agent_config.json`).

## 🪵 Immutable Change Log

### [2026-06-14] - Automatic Call Handoff Feature
* **Context:** User requested the ability to setup "automatic call handoff" to automatically transfer calls to a human agent based on dynamic conditions without asking for permission.
* **Scope:**
  - `data/agent_config.json` — Added `automatic_handoff` and `handoff_conditions` fields to default schema.
  - `dashboard/app/api/agent-config/route.ts` — Exposed new config fields.
  - `dashboard/components/AgentConfigForm.tsx` — Added UI toggle and text area to configure the handoff conditions.
  - `config_inbound.py` / `config_outbound.py` — Parsed the new config variables into globals.
  - `agent_inbound.py` / `agent_outbound.py` — Modified the LLM instructions to explicitly prepend strict instructions for calling the transfer tools when the `AUTOMATIC_HANDOFF` rule evaluates as true.
* **Impact:** Agents can now automatically escalate calls to humans when frustrated users or unsupported requests are detected (or any condition provided by the user).

### [2026-06-14] - Voice Preview Button + Language Support Chips in Dashboard
* **Context:** User requested ability to audition each TTS voice before saving, and to see which languages a voice supports.
* **Scope:**
  - `dashboard/app/api/voice-preview/route.ts` [NEW] — GET endpoint that calls Sarvam/Deepgram/Cartesia/OpenAI TTS APIs with a short sample sentence and returns the audio bytes. Supports per-language sample texts (hi-IN, ta-IN, te-IN, kn-IN, ml-IN, mr-IN, gu-IN, bn-IN, pa-IN, en-IN, en-US). 12s timeout with proper error responses.
  - `dashboard/components/AgentConfigForm.tsx` — Voice column now has: (1) `▶ Preview` button that fetches live TTS audio and plays it in-browser, transitions to `⏹ Stop` while playing; (2) language chips row showing which languages the selected voice/provider supports, auto-computed per provider.
* **Impact:** Users can instantly hear any voice without making a call. Language chips show "Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, …" for Sarvam or "English (US)" for Deepgram etc.

### [2026-06-14] - Add Google Gemini LLM Support + Fix OpenAI Fallback Crash
* **Context:** Agent crashed with `OpenAIError: OPENAI_API_KEY not set` because `_build_llm()` blindly fell back to `openai.LLM()` when the provider wasn't "groq". User has Gemini key but no OpenAI key.
* **Scope:**
  - `agent_outbound.py` + `agent_inbound.py` — Rewrote `_build_llm()`: added Google/Gemini support via `livekit-plugins-google`, added guarded OpenAI path (only used if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set), changed final fallback from bare `openai.LLM()` to safe Groq fallback. Added `try/except ImportError` for Google plugin to avoid hard failure.
  - `agent_inbound.py` — Also fixed `_build_tts()` stale Sarvam voice list (same fix as outbound).
  - `requirements.txt` — Added `livekit-plugins-google>=0.6.0`.
  - `.env` — Added `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash`, reorganized Gemini section with comment.
* **Impact:** Agents no longer crash when OpenAI key is absent. Google Gemini is now a selectable LLM provider from the dashboard. Groq is always the safe last-resort fallback.

### [2026-06-14] - Fix Sarvam bulbul:v3 Incompatible Speaker Crash
* **Context:** Outbound agent crashed on every call with `ValueError: Speaker 'aravind' is not compatible with model 'bulbul:v3'`. Sarvam updated `bulbul:v3` to a new speaker list that dropped `anushka`, `aravind`, `amartya`, `dhruv`, `meera`, `pavithra`, `maitreyi`, `arvind`, `arjun`, `abhilash`.
* **Valid bulbul:v3 speakers:** shubh, ritu, rahul, pooja, simran, kavya, amit, ratan, rohan, dev, ishita, shreya, manan, sumit, priya, aditya, kabir, neha, varun, roopa, aayan, ashutosh, advait, amelia, sophia.
* **Scope:**
  - `config_outbound.py` — Updated `DEFAULT_TTS_VOICE` from `"aravind"` → `"rahul"`. Updated `fetch_sarvam_voices()` fallback list to only valid bulbul:v3 speakers.
  - `config_inbound.py` — Updated `DEFAULT_TTS_VOICE` from `"anushka"` → `"ishita"`.
  - `agent_outbound.py` — Replaced hardcoded old-voice list in `_build_tts()` with the full valid bulbul:v3 speaker set.
  - `dashboard/lib/providers.ts` — Replaced Sarvam FALLBACK_CATALOG voices with all 25 valid bulbul:v3 speakers.
  - `data/agent_config.json` — Patched saved dashboard config: outbound `aravind` → `rahul`, inbound `anushka` → `ishita`.
* **Impact:** Outbound and inbound agents will no longer crash on startup due to invalid speaker selection. Dashboard voice dropdowns now only show valid voices.

### [2026-06-14] - Fix React Duplicate Key Error in Select Component
* **Context:** Next.js console threw errors stating "Encountered two children with the same key, '2-finance'" (and '2-meeting') when rendering AgentConfigForm. This occurred because live provider API results returned duplicate entries in the model list.
* **Scope:**
  - Added value deduplication to the `Select` component in `dashboard/components/AgentConfigForm.tsx` to filter out duplicate option values before rendering.
* **Impact:** Resolved React rendering warnings/errors, ensuring dropdown selections remain clean and unique.

### [2026-06-13] - Fix Sarvam TTS Model Version Compatibility Crash
* **Context:** The outbound agent crashed during call setup when `aravind` was selected as the speaker because the root `.env` hardcoded `SARVAM_TTS_MODEL=bulbul:v2`, which is incompatible with `aravind`.
* **Scope:**
  - Updated the root `.env` file to set `SARVAM_TTS_MODEL=bulbul:v3`.
* **Impact:** Resolved speaker compatibility crashes for Sarvam TTS, allowing calls to go through using the selected voice.

### [2026-06-13] - Fix Outbound Agent TTS Pre-Warming TypeError
* **Context:** The outbound voice agent crashed when starting a new session due to a `TypeError` in `asyncio.create_task` because `session.say(...)` returns a `SpeechHandle` (an awaitable) instead of a coroutine object.
* **Scope:**
  - Wrapped `session.say(" ", allow_interruptions=True)` in an helper `async def warm_up()` function inside `agent_outbound.py`.
* **Impact:** Fixed the outbound agent crash on start, enabling outbound calls to successfully connect and initiate speech.

### [2026-06-13] - Implement Dynamic Currency Conversion and Formatting Across Dashboard
* **Context:** Changing the currency settings (INR, USD, EUR, GBP) did not update the currency formatting/symbols in the overview cards and Wallet dashboard.
* **Scope:**
  - Added and exported a dynamic `CurrencySymbol` component from `dashboard/components/FormattedCurrency.tsx`.
  - Updated the "Total Spend" overview card in `dashboard/app/page.tsx` to render using the dynamic `FormattedCurrency` and `CurrencySymbol` components.
  - Refactored `dashboard/components/WalletDashboard.tsx` to pull the active currency and exchange rates from `useAppContext()`, dynamically converting all wallet balance, spending breakdowns, and recent transaction values.
* **Impact:** The selected currency now correctly translates and formats all cost and balance values dynamically across the entire project.

### [2026-06-13] - Fix Frontend dev Server Loop & Enable Log Runner Capturing
* **Context:** Running `npm run dev` in dashboard failed to start the local host server and instead exited immediately. The user wanted both the log runner to capture logs and the server to run.
* **Scope:**
  - Re-routed `dashboard/package.json`'s `"dev"` script back to `"python ../log_runner.py frontend"`.
  - Modified `log_runner.py`'s frontend runner to call `["npx", "next", "dev"]` directly instead of recursively calling `["npm", "run", "dev"]`.
* **Impact:** `npm run dev` now runs via `log_runner.py` without recursion, launching Next.js on `http://localhost:3000` and successfully capturing all logs to the `logs/` directory.

### [2026-06-12] - Voice Calling Agent Conversational Experience & Latency Optimizations
* **Context:** Optimized inbound and outbound voice agents for lower latency, higher quality TTS, and dynamic multilingual capabilities.
* **Scope:**
  - Upgraded Sarvam TTS model to `"bulbul:v3"` in `config_inbound.py` and `config_outbound.py` for more natural speech.
  - Implemented dynamic STT language detection (`detect_language=True` when `STT_LANGUAGE = "auto"`) in `agent_inbound.py` and `agent_outbound.py`.
  - Added TTS pre-warming via silent pings (`session.say(" ")`) on session startup to eliminate WebSocket connection latency during first greetings.
  - Optimized dashboard config load times by checking file modification time (`mtime`) before reloading.
* **Impact:** Reduced initial greeting response latency and significantly improved agent conversational understanding and speech naturalness.
* **Verification:** Verified config structure loading and parameter defaults.

### [2026-06-12] - Automatic Logging, Summary Generation, and Log Cleanup
* **Context:** Automated backend/frontend logs capture, summary reports, and auto-cleanup for logs older than 1 month.
* **Scope:**
  - Configured `dashboard/package.json` to route dev servers through `log_runner.py`.
  - Re-architected `run.py` to act as a log wrapper for agents, auto-saving stdout/stderr to timestamped files with summaries on exit.
  - Added a monthly (30-day) log cleanup function to `log_runner.py` and `run.py`.
* **Impact:** Seamless background log generation with summary reports on manual runs, keeping the log directory clean.

### [2026-06-11] - Premium UI Standardization & Dashboard Overhaul
* **Context:** Overhauled the global design system to use a high-end "Premium Solid" aesthetic (clean typography, crisp borders, dark solid backgrounds) based on user design specs.
* **Scope:**
  - Upgraded global `glass-card` CSS classes in `dashboard/styles/globals.css` from blurry/transparent to premium solid (`#1A1A1A`) with border radius and subtle glowing borders.
  - Rebuilt Dashboard layout (`app/page.tsx`) to implement the premium typography and layout grid while restoring the original `getOverviewStats` data components.
  - Implemented responsive React AreaCharts (`CostGraph.tsx`) with stunning `linearGradient` fills instead of flat transparent colors.
  - Redesigned `Sidebar.tsx` and `TopHeader.tsx` to match the solid dark theme, adding Framer Motion sliding pill indicators.
  - Fixed Recharts `<Brush>` console errors (NaN `x`/`width`) on first render.
* **Impact:** Global design language unified across all pages (Dialer, Workflows, Leads). All functional AI components retained.

### [2026-06-11] - Project Infrastructure Upgrade
* **Context:** Added project documentation, env segregation, automated testing, and logging infrastructure to improve developer experience and debugging.
* **Scope:**
  - Created `memory.md` (this file) — project architecture documentation
  - Segregated `.env` (backend) and `dashboard/.env.local` (frontend) with `.env.example` templates
  - Created `tester_agent.py` — automated health checks for UI and backend
  - Created `log_runner.py` + `logs/` — timestamped log capture with error summaries
  - Updated `GEMINI.md` global rules to reference log summaries for error fixing
  - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `logs/` directory
* **Impact:** No breaking changes. All existing functionality preserved. New tooling is additive.
* **Verification:** Manual testing of `tester_agent.py` and `log_runner.py` on both backend and frontend.

### [2026-06-13] - Fix Outbound SIP Trunk ID Mismatch
* **Context:** Outbound and inbound calls were failing with `TwirpError: object cannot be found`. Root cause was a stale `VOBIZ_SIP_TRUNK_ID` in `.env` pointing to a trunk that no longer exists in LiveKit.
* **Scope:**
  - Updated `VOBIZ_SIP_TRUNK_ID` in `.env` from `ST_FN8TAbxQaYnn` → `ST_GpnrjlpsVC2K` (matching the active LiveKit outbound trunk)
  - `INBOUND_TRUNK_ID=ST_6EDBHqmcr7rs` was already correct (matches LiveKit inbound trunk)
* **Root Cause:** The outbound SIP trunk had been recreated in LiveKit (new ID assigned) but the `.env` was never updated to reflect the new trunk ID.
* **Impact:** Outbound calls should now connect successfully. Requires backend agent restart to pick up the new env value.

### [2026-06-13] - Dynamic Provider Voices & Models (Zero Hardcoding)
* **Context:** All voice/model dropdowns in the UI were hardcoded. User wanted fully dynamic pulling from provider APIs.
* **Scope:**
  - NEW `dashboard/lib/providers.ts` — central TypeScript types, fallback catalog for all providers (Sarvam, OpenAI, Groq, Cartesia, Deepgram)
  - NEW `dashboard/app/api/providers/route.ts` — live API endpoint that fetches voices/models from each provider in parallel with 10-min in-memory caching. Falls back to static catalog on failure. Supports `DELETE` to bust cache.
  - UPDATED `dashboard/components/AgentConfigForm.tsx` — all TTS/STT/LLM selects now fetch from `/api/providers`. Green live-indicator dot when data is live. Refresh button to re-fetch. Provider switching auto-selects first valid voice/model.
  - UPDATED `dashboard/components/CallDispatcher.tsx` — same live catalog. Voice list dynamically updates when TTS provider changes.
  - UPDATED `config_outbound.py` — `fetch_sarvam_voices()`, `fetch_groq_models()`, `get_valid_sarvam_voice()`, `get_valid_groq_model()` helpers added. In-memory cached. Graceful fallback if API unreachable.
  - UPDATED `config_inbound.py` — imports helpers from `config_outbound` (single source of truth).
* **Impact:** No hardcoded voice/model lists anywhere. Live data from provider APIs at startup and on page load.

### [2026-06-14] - Interactive TTS Language Chips & Override Fix
* **Context:** The UI language chips were static, and when a user did initiate a call with a non-English language (like Hindi), the outbound agent ignored the language and spoke English, causing the terminal to crash due to a Unicode encoding issue when printing Hindi characters.
* **Scope:**
  - Upgraded language chips in `AgentConfigForm.tsx`, `CallDispatcher.tsx`, and `BulkDialer.tsx` to be fully interactive (clickable), reactive, and self-sorting based on the selected active language.
  - Fixed `/api/dispatch` to correctly pack `tts_provider` and `tts_language` into the LiveKit dispatch metadata.
  - Upgraded `agent_outbound.py`'s `_build_tts()` function to accept dynamic language overrides from the job metadata instead of falling back to default.
  - Modified `OutboundAssistant` (LLM Agent) to dynamically inject a critical system prompt forcing it to speak the specified target language instead of English.
  - Upgraded `run.py` to enforce `utf-8` on `sys.stdout` and `PYTHONIOENCODING` to prevent `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters` crashes when the backend logs Hindi/non-English text.
* **Impact:** Users can seamlessly initiate outbound calls in any supported language with a single click, and the AI will reliably converse in that language without crashing the backend process.
